MockHTTPInC
===========

MockHTTPInC is a library that wants to make in-depth testing of HTTP client code possible. The library provides:
- a HTTP server that can be instructed to handle requests in certain ways (e.g. returning a prebaked response, request a SSL client certificate etc.).
- a HTTPS server that supports the full SSL/TLS handshake, client certificates, session renegotiation and session resumption
- a simple HTTP/HTTPS proxy 

Getting started
---------------


The library is based on code originally written to test the serf HTTP client (http://serf.googlecode.com).
